This is a project I made for Trybe, a school to teach people become fullstack web developers.

Here you'll see a basic Rest API with Node.js and Express. There's middlewares to get strict values into
the Endpoints.

Most important parts: 1. it was made with a Docker container, which means anyone can access this code with Docker knowledge.

2. It is not an API with Database connection, it was made with native Node.js methods to read and update an
local Database file.
